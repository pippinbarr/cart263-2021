## Summary

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the language we use to express the **style** and some **layout** of web pages. It uses **selectors** to target parts of a page to style, and **properties** to specify the style. Excellent documentation is available from [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).

## What is CSS?

CSS stands for (**C**)ascading (**S**)tyle (**S**)heets. It's the language we use to express **style** and some more sophisticated **layout** for a webpage.

CSS works by using **selectors** to target which parts of a webpage to style and **properties** to specify the styling itself.

CSS perhaps most ideally lives in a text file with extension `.css`, but can also be included in a `<style>` tag inside the `<head>` tag of an HTML file, or even as a `style` attribute for a specific HTML tag.

What we're really interested in it building toward doing things with CSS via JavaScript! So, this discussion is not intended to make anyone a master of CSS, but rather to get the basics of its structure and use.

Let's style a very simple webpage using CSS to illustrate key component parts.

---

## An HTML file

Here's some simple HTML that we can style using CSS:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Title of webpage</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Main heading</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h2>Sub-heading</h2>
      <p>A paragraph of text. Here is an <em>emphasized</em> word.</p>
      <img src="assets/images/clown.png" alt="A clown emoji.">
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Another sub-heading</h2>
      <p>Another paragraph of text. <strong>This is important</strong>.</p>
      <p>Here is a <a href="https://thi.cc/">thicc link</a>.</p>
      <a href="https://thi.cc/">
        <img src="assets/images/clown.png" alt="A clown emoji.">
      </a>
    </section>

    <footer>
      <strong>Contact details</strong>: don't call me, I'll call you.
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

Let's put that in an `index.html` file in a project folder so that we have a website we can work with. If we view it in our browser right now it'll just be standard HTML with no extra styling.

---

## A CSS file

We write CSS inside a plain text file with the extension `.css`. The file can have any name, but `style.css` is quite a common default. This file will represent the styling information for any webpage that uses it.

So, to begin with we create an empty text file called `style.css`. If we're being organized, it's a nice idea to put it in a `css/` folder.

Given that this file is empty, it won't do anything of course. But it **also** won't do anything because we have to tell our webpage to **use** it.

In order to tell a webpage to **use** the CSS in our file, we need to use a `<link>` tag inside the `<head>` tag. It works like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Title of webpage</title>

    <!-- NEW! Link to the style sheet file! -->
    <link href="css/style.css" rel="stylesheet">

  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Main heading</h1>
    </header>

    <section>
      <h2>Sub-heading</h2>
      <p>A paragraph of text. Here is an <em>emphasized</em> word.</p>
      <img src="assets/images/clown.png" alt="A clown emoji.">
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Another sub-heading</h2>
      <p>Another paragraph of text. <strong>This is important</strong>.</p>
      <p>Here is a <a href="https://thi.cc/">thicc link</a>.</p>
      <a href="https://thi.cc/">
        <img src="assets/images/clown.png" alt="A clown emoji.">
      </a>
    </section>

    <footer>
      <strong>Contact details</strong>: don't call me, I'll call you.
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

As you can see the `<link>` tag uses two key attributes:

* `href` is set to point to the file itself
* `rel` is set to `stylesheet` to inform the browser of the type of file being linked

Now the style sheet file is **linked** to our HTML file and any styling information we put in `style.css` will be applied to the contents of `index.html`.

Again, there's no actual styling information in the file, so nothing new is happening yet!

---

## Selectors and properties

In order to use CSS we need to know about **selectors** and **properties**.

**Selectors** are used to target specific parts of our HTML for styling. They can most obviously target **tags** to style.

**Properties** specify the style we want to apply to the selected HTML.

So if we want to style everything inside the `<body>` tag so that it uses the font Helvetica, we could write the following in `style.css`:

```css
body {
  font-family: Helvetica;
}
```

Here `body` is the **selector**. It tells the browser that the styling information will be applied to everything inside the `<body>` tag. (Note we don't include the angle brackets when selecting the tag, just the tag name.)

We specify the styling properties inside **curly brackets** after the selector.

The property and its value require the following:

* `font-family` is the **property name**, it tells us the specific kind of styling we want to apply to the `<body>` tag, which is to set its font.
* `:` (a colon) separates the property name from the value to set it to
* `Helvetica` is the **value** we want to set the property to, in this case the name of the font to use,
* `;` (a semi-colon) indicates the property and value are complete.

If we look at the page and we have Helvetica installed on our computer, everything inside the `<body>` tag will be using that font.

### Fallback options

If we **don't** have Helvetica, we'll end up with the default, which is probably some kind of serifed font, which we probably didn't want since Helvetica is a sans-serif font.

If we want to specify a series of fallback options for the `font-family` property, we can list more options separated by commas. It's common to include a generic option like `sans-serif` or `serif` to indicate a very broad preference:

```css
body {
  font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
```

Now even if the user doesn't have Helvetica, they'll get a default sans-serif font.

---

## More specific selectors

We targeted the entire `<body>` tag, but we can target something more specific like the `<h2>` tag if we want to only style our **sub-headings** this way:

```css
h2 {
  font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
```

Now only the `<h2>` tags have Helvetica (or sans-serif)

---

## Multiple properties

For any given selector we can specify **multiple** styling properties. So we could include a `color` property, for example...

```css
h2 {
  font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
  color: #ff8888;
}
```

Now the sub-headings are in Helvetica **and** they're pink.

---

## Multiple selectors

We can have as many selectors as we wish in our CSS styling, and this allows us to really specifically target particular parts of our document!

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 3rem;
}

h2 {
  font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
  color: #ff8888;
}

p {
  color: #444444;
}
```

Now we've changed the font size of the main heading (`<h1>`) and also set the color of text in paragraphs (`<p>`). We could go on like this forever!

---

## Selecting more than thing at once

We can apply specific styling to a set of different targets by listing the selectors in a comma-separated list:

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 3rem;
}

h2 {
  font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;
  color: #ff8888;
}

p {
  color: #444444;
}

/* Style both strong and em tags */
strong, em {
  color: #4488aa;
}
```

---

## Values and units

We've already seen three different kinds of **values** used in our CSS so far:

* Font sizes specified in the `rem` unit (this is a "root em", where `1rem` is the default for the overall `html` tag and you can change font sizes based on that knowledge, thus `3rem` is three times larger than the default)
* Fonts specified as text (e.g. `Helvetica` or `sans-serif`)
* Colors specified as hexademicals (e.g. `#4488aa`)

There are many different kinds of values and units available in CSS and we need to make sure we **read the documentation** for any property we're using to check the available possibilities.

Note, for example, how the documentation for the [`color` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color) tells us that we can specify the color in many different ways, not just hexademical.

---

## Documentation

Once again, central to using CSS well is to **read the documentation**. The Mozilla [CSS documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) and especially the [CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) are invaluable places to look up all the specifics you might be wondering about, as well as just to browse the sheer variety of possible properties and values.

## `id` and `class`

So far we've looked at using selectors that can target specific **tags** on our webpage. This is clearly really useful, but it can make it hard to target more specific elements or sets of elements.

For this reason, we very often need to use the `id` or `class` attributes with our HTML elements to make them easily selectable in CSS.

The `id` attribute is used for a **unique** HTML element that is the only one of its kind that we want to select with CSS.

The `class` attribute is used for a **set** of HTML elements that we want to select with CSS.

### Adding `id` and `class` attributes

So, in our example, we might give an `id` to our first `<section>` tag and a `class` to the `<p>` tags inside our our second section...

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Title of webpage</title>
    <!-- Link to the style sheet file! -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Main heading</h1>
    </header>

    <!-- NEW! This section now has an id attribute -->
    <section id="first-section">
      <h2>Sub-heading</h2>
      <p>A paragraph of text.</p>
      <p>A paragraph of text. Here is an <em>emphasized</em> word.</p>
      <img src="assets/images/clown.png" alt="A clown emoji.">
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Another sub-heading</h2>
      <!-- NEW! These two paragraphs now have the same class attribute -->
      <p class="second-section-paragraph">
        Another paragraph of text. <strong>This is important</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="second-section-paragraph">
        Here is a <a href="https://thi.cc/">thicc link</a>.
      </p>
      <a href="https://thi.cc/">
        <img src="assets/images/clown.png" alt="A clown emoji.">
      </a>
    </section>

    <footer>
      <strong>Contact details</strong>: don't call me, I'll call you.
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Selecting an `id`

With this in place we can target the `id` of `first-section` in our CSS by adding a selector like this:

```css
#first-section {
  background-color: rgb(200,200,200);
}
```

Note that we select the `id` by writing its **name prefixed with a `#`**.

Now the entire first section has a light grey background!

### Selecting a `class`

We can target the `class` of `second-section-paragraph` in our CSS by adding a selector like this:

```css
.second-section-paragraph {
 background-color: rgb(200,255,255);
}
```

Note that we select the `class` by writing its **name prefixed with a `.`**.

Now the individual paragraphs in the second section have a light cyan background!

---

## Use `id` and `class`

Both `id` and `class` are a **very** powerful way to style your webpage because they allow you to target really specific parts of the document.

Just remember that you use `id` when there's only **one** element that will use a style, and use `class` when there are multiple elements that will share a style.

---

## `<span>` tags

An HTML element that is specifically useful when used with `CSS` is the `<span>` tag. This enables to us to put specific content inside a tag that we can target with CSS.

Unlike a `<div>` or other sectioning tag, the `<span>` tag is not structural, it will purely select what's inside it, most obviously some text. So, for example...

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Title of webpage</title>
    <!-- Link to the style sheet file! -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      This is the <span class="time">time</span> and this is the record of the <span class="time">time</span>.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

We can now target the text inside those `<span>` tags and style them however we'd like to...

```css
.time {
  font-family: monospace;
}
```

A useful little idea to keep in mind when you want to target really specific parts of your HTML but it's not wrapped in a specific tag already. Use `<span>` for this.

---

## Pseudo-classes

A quick word about pseudo-classes, which allow us to add on top of the existing selectors with some specific extra ideas. We add them to **existing** selectors...

* `:hover` selects an element that has the mouse hovering over it
* `:nth-child(2)` selects the elements that are the second child of their parent
* `:invalid` selects form elements that are not validated successfully

So if we want our links to change color when the user's mouse is over them, we could add:

```css
a:hover {
  color: yellow; /* Yes, you can just write some color names in English! */
}
```

There are many of these and they're worth reading about! Again, the [Mozilla Pseudo-classes documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) is excellent.

---

## There is a lot more to CSS

There are a lot of possibilities within CSS and it can be overwhelming. The most important ideas and approaches are:

* At heart, CSS is about **selecting** elements in the HTML and **styling** them via properties and values
* **Read the documentation** (again, the [Mozilla CSS documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) is great)
* **Layout** is a whole impressive part of CSS that you can investigate. The [Mozilla CSS Layout documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout) is a good place to start on this. The CSS Grid has become very popular.
* **Animation** is a very nice feature of contemporary CSS, check out the [Mozilla CSS animation documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation) if you're interested.
* **Do tutorials** like the [freeCodeCamp CSS lessons](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/basic-css/) if you're feeling wobbly.
* **Look at other people's CSS** if you want to get ideas for how to accomplish things (you can use the "Inspector" option in your browser to examine the CSS on a page).

## Too much information?

### CSS in the `<head>` tag

We can include a `<style>` tag inside the `<head>` tag of an HTML file to specify CSS to be applied to that page. This will **override** CSS specified in any linked style files.

```html
<head>
  <title>The Big Red Page</title>
  <style>
  /* Style paragraphs to be big and red */
  p {
    color: #ff0000;
    font-size: 2rem;
  }
  </style>
</head>
```

---

### CSS in the `style` attribute

We can include a `style` attribute with any HTML element to apply CSS to that element. This will override **all** other styling. For example:

```html
<p style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 2rem">This is large, red text.</p>
```

# }
