## Summary

The [ObjectDetector](https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/object-detector) system in [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/) allows us to use a pre-trained or user-created model to detect objects in images (including static images, video, or a webcam feed). Depending on the model, we can detect all kinds of objects in images and respond to them with a program!

## Nice to meet you!

So that's a first meeting with ml5.js. We have some idea of what the library does and some idea of what writing code for it might look like. From here we're in a position to dive in and get some of the technical details in place to actually build our own projects with it!
