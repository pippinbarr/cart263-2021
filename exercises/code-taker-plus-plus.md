## Objectives
* Playing with jQuery UI

---

## Setup

1. Start a new project by duplicating your Code Taker activity project folder and renaming it `code-taker-plus-plus` (or something else).
2. Move this new project folder into your `exercises` folder in your course repository
3. Commit these changes to your repository with an appropriate message like `E7: Starting code`
4. Open the project in Atom and begin!

## Brief

Your objective is to add functionality to the existing *Code Taker* to make it more interesting and engaging. Or more strange, or disturbing, or funny, or something else entirely! Implement **at least three** of the following:

* Rework the HTML and CSS to make this a more engaging presentation of the idea
* Change to a different text and secret message to make it your own
* Add a modal instructions dialog when the page loads that explains to the user what they're meant to be doing
* Change to a different style of secret message (use words? user emojis? have things out of order? have multiple possible messages?)
* Add some more impressive effects to the different actions like finding secret letters, dragging them, dropping them, and getting the secret answer
* Add a sound effect using the [HTMLAudioElement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAudioElement#basic_usage) that plays when the user solves the puzzle
* Allow the user to remove letters from the answer area in case they mess up
* Add the ability to view the secret letters in situ with a special button or keyboard command that fades out the rest of the poem
* Reverse the idea by having the user drag and drop words **into** a poem (or other text), a bit more like Mad Libs
* Translate the idea to use images instead of text to create a pictogram version of the challenge
* Use a library like [Splitting.js](https://splitting.js.org/guide.html) to make **all** the characters (or words) in the text draggable but give the user hints as to the correct answer they need to build up
* Change to a different style of interaction than dragging and dropping (make the words build up and move with the cursor on selection?)
* ... and many more?

Some of these are straightforward and some are not. Choose wisely such that you get some good programming practice and challenge yourself, but not so that you stress out!

If you have other ideas for additions and changes, go ahead, so long as you add at least three new things and learn something.

## Submission

Submission will take place on **Moodle**. Go to the appropriately named **exercise** on the Moodle and then submit your work there.

Your submission should just be plain text that includes (substituting your GitHub username and any difference in the folder names):

1. A link to your exercise code (e.g. https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart263/tree/master/exercises/code-taker-plus-plus/)
2. A link to your project on the web (e.g. https://pippinbarr.github.io/cart263/exercises/code-taker-plus-plus/)

## Evaluation

Grading for exercises is pass/fail. Passing requires **all** of the following to be satisfactory:

- **Runs** and **meets the brief**
- Is **well structured**, with new code added in sensible places in sensible orders
- Includes a **starting commit** and then a reasonable number of commits throughout the work that include **descriptive messages** about what was done. Messages should be **prefixed by `E7:`** (e.g. `E7: Changed text to represent Shakespeare's "Shall I compare thee to a Summer's day?" in emoji`).
- Follows all **style guidelines** (see the [Style Guide](../guides/style-guide.md))
