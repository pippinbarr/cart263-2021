## Objectives
* Playing with Phaser 3

---

## Setup

1. Start a new project by duplicating your Desperately Seeking Sadness activity project folder and renaming it `desperately-seeking-sadness-plus-plus` (or something else).
2. Move this new project folder into your `exercises` folder in your course repository
3. Commit these changes to your repository with an appropriate message like `E8: Starting code`
4. Open the project in Atom and begin!

## Brief

Your objective is to add functionality to the existing *Desperately Seeking Sadness* to make it more interesting and engaging. Or more strange, or disturbing, or funny, or something else entirely! Implement **at least three** of the following:

* Play with the physics options to improve on the "game feel"
* Add another type of emoji (or other element) to the world of the game with different physics properties
* Change to a different metaphor with different images but the same core idea of collection in a physics based world
* Add sound effects to collection and collision
* Add title and instructions scenes
* Add an ending to the game (run out of time? too happy?) and a "game over" scene
* Add immovable elements that the player has to navigate along with the moving thumbs downs
* Make the collectable (or a new one) change the way the avatar moves (slow them down? speed them up?)
* Add gravity to the simulation (maybe it only affects the avatar to add to their struggle?)
* Develop a more complex model of the avatar's mood so it's dropped down by the thumbs down but slightly raised by the thumbs ups, challenge them to stay unhappy!
* Give the thumbs up and thumbs down emojis some "AI" so that they move around on their own accord (randomly? chasing? fleeing?)
* Choose any example(s) in the Phaser 3 examples and implement the idea in the game
* ... and many more?

Some of these are straightforward and some are not. Choose wisely such that you get some good programming practice and challenge yourself, but not so that you stress out!

If you have other ideas for additions and changes, go ahead, so long as you add at least three new things and learn something.

## Submission

Submission will take place on **Moodle**. Go to the appropriately named **exercise** on the Moodle and then submit your work there.

Your submission should just be plain text that includes (substituting your GitHub username and any difference in the folder names):

1. A link to your exercise code (e.g. https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart263/tree/master/exercises/desperately-seeking-sadness-plus-plus/)
2. A link to your project on the web (e.g. https://pippinbarr.github.io/cart263/exercises/desperately-seeking-sadness-plus-plus/)

## Evaluation

Grading for exercises is pass/fail. Passing requires **all** of the following to be satisfactory:

- **Runs** and **meets the brief**
- Is **well structured**, with new code added in sensible places in sensible orders
- Includes a **starting commit** and then a reasonable number of commits throughout the work that include **descriptive messages** about what was done. Messages should be **prefixed by `E8:`** (e.g. `E8: Reimplemented the game as a metaphor for repressed memories`).
- Follows all **style guidelines** (see the [Style Guide](../guides/style-guide.md))
