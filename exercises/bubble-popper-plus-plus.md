## Objectives
* Playing with ml5.js!

---

## Setup

1. Start a new project by duplicating your Bubble Popper activity project folder and renaming it `bubble-popper-plus-plus` (or something else).
2. Move this new project folder into your `exercises` folder in your course repository
3. Commit these changes to your repository with an appropriate message like `E4: Starting code`
4. Open the project in Atom and begin!

## Brief

Your objective is to add functionality to the existing *Bubble Popper* to make it more interesting and engaging. Or more strange, or disturbing, or funny, or something else entirely! Implement **at least three** of the following:

* Count how many bubbles the user has popped over time
* Improve the audiovisual presentation of the program with more interesting visuals and sound effects
* Make it increasingly difficult to pop the bubble over time (it could get faster? smaller?)
* Add loading, title, and instructions screens and maybe an "ending" to the program to make it into more of a total package
* Make the bubble avoid the user's pin by moving or even teleporting when they get to close (but don't make it impossible!)
* Let the user bump the bubble in different directions with the head of the pin (like need to keep track of the pin's velocity by checking its position change frame to frame)
* Add multiple bubbles to the simulation (probably want to convert the program to Object-Oriented Programming)
* Add different types of bubbles (maybe you shouldn't pop some of them, maybe they all react different to being poked with the pin...)
* Make different objects (or something) drop out of a bubble when it's popped (you could be "rescuing them" or receiving them as "prizes" or something else)
* Use a different ml5.js feature to represent the pin (could use the Object Detector to require the player uses a pair of scissors? Though you could represent rotation then...)
* Give the user a different tool than a pin that has a different effect on the bubble (could you give them a bubble blower that emits bubbles as they wave it around?)
* Put a different tool on each finger of the user's hand?
* Let the user change between different tools by closing and opening their hand? (How would you detect a closed hand? Their finger-tips would be closer than usual to the base of their palm...)
* Integrate another library or other technology you know about into the experience to add to the possibilities (could random words fall out of bubbles? Could fortunes fall out or be read aloud? Could the bubbles talk to you? Could you talk to them? Could you say sorry before you pop them?)
* Change the underlying meaning of the simulation by have the user's interaction with the bubble (or other object) be positive, helping it to grow or get stronger or feel happier or something else (could this turn into a gardening simulation or something?!)

Some of these are straightforward and some are not. Choose wisely such that you get some good programming practice and challenge yourself, but not so that you stress out!

If you have other ideas for additions and changes, go ahead, so long as you add at least three new things and learn something.

## Submission

Submission will take place on **Moodle**. Go to the appropriately named **exercise** on the Moodle and then submit your work there.

Your submission should just be plain text that includes (substituting your GitHub username and any difference in the folder names):

1. A link to your exercise code (e.g. https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart263/tree/master/exercises/bubble-popper-plus-plus/)
2. A link to your project on the web (e.g. https://pippinbarr.github.io/cart263/exercises/bubble-popper-plus-plus/)

## Evaluation

Grading for exercises is pass/fail. Passing requires **all** of the following to be satisfactory:

- **Runs** and **meets the brief**
- Is **well structured**, with new code added in sensible places in sensible orders
- Includes a **starting commit** and then a reasonable number of commits throughout the work that include **descriptive messages** about what was done. Messages should be **prefixed by `E4:`** (e.g. `E4: Added bubble that attacks the user's eyes!`).
- Follows all **style guidelines** (see the [Style Guide](../guides/style-guide.md))
