## Objectives
* Playing with data and storage!

---

## Setup

1. Start a new project by duplicating your Spy Profile Generator activity project folder and renaming it `spy-profile-generator-plus` (or something else).
2. Move this new project folder into your `exercises` folder in your course repository
3. Commit these changes to your repository with an appropriate message like `E3: Starting code`
4. Open the project in Atom and begin!

## Brief

Your objective is to add functionality to the existing *Spy Profile Generator* to make it more interesting and engaging. Or more strange, or disturbing, or funny, or something else entirely! Implement **at least three** of the following:

* Add more categories to the profile and generate them with other data
* Add the ability to delete the current profile data with a keyboard command or button
* Improve the visual display of the profile
* Use voice synthesis and voice recognition for the identification process
* Find more creative ways to generate profile values, such as combining parts of different sets of data
* Allow the user to regenerate their entire profile (other than their name) if they don't like it
* Allow the user to selectively regenerate specific categories in the profile (by clicking on them? with keyboard keys? with their voice?) to get one they like
* Ask for a username and password instead of just a password (generate the username?)
* Allow the user to manually enter their entire profile if desired, and just use the random data as default values
* Allow for multiple users of the page by saving an **array** of profiles and loading the correct one based on the password entered

Some of these are straightforward and some are not. Choose wisely such that you get some good programming practice and challenge yourself, but not so that you stress out!

If you have other ideas for additions and changes, go ahead, so long as you add at least three new things and learn something.

## Submission

Submission will take place on **Moodle**. Go to the appropriately named **exercise** on the Moodle and then submit your work there.

Your submission should just be plain text that includes (substituting your GitHub username and any difference in the folder names):

1. A link to your exercise code (e.g. https://github.com/pippinbarr/cart263/tree/master/exercises/spy-profile-generator-plus/)
2. A link to your project on the web (e.g. https://pippinbarr.github.io/cart263/exercises/spy-profile-generator-plus/)

## Evaluation

Grading for exercises is pass/fail. Passing requires **all** of the following to be satisfactory:

- **Runs** and **meets the brief**
- Is **well structured**, with new code added in sensible places in sensible orders
- Includes a **starting commit** and then a reasonable number of commits throughout the work that include **descriptive messages** about what was done. Messages should be **prefixed by `E3:`** (e.g. `E3: Added a "languages spoken" property to the profile.`).
- Follows all **style guidelines** (see the [Style Guide](../guides/style-guide.md))
