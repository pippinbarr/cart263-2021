/**

Endless Dialogs
Pippin Barr

Some kind of UI hell!
We must imagine UI Sisyphus happy???

A dialog is triggered as soon as you move the cursor.
Responding to it makes things worse. Every response guarantees a new dialog.
Moving the cursor "too much" generates more dialogs.
You are deluged with mediocre existentialist philosophy about Sisyphus and Camus.

  "If Sisyphus is happy, what does that make you?",
  "Would you trade places with Sisyphus if he assured you that he was happy?",
  "If someone told you that pushing rocks uphill is the definition of happiness, how inclined would you be to believe them?",
  "I have this rock in my back yard, want to come over and help me push it up a hill?",
  "Is anyone really capable of happiness in the end, whether they're pushing a rock uphill or not?",
  "Would Sisyphus smile happily at Camus if he found out Camus imagines that he's happy?",
