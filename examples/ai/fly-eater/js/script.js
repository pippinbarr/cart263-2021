/**

Fly Eater
Pippin Barr

A program that allows you to eat virtual flies via the webcam. Displays
you on screen and uses ml5's implementation of Facemesh to detect your mouth
and whether it's open or closed. Close your mouth while a fly is "in" it to
eat the fly. Yum yum.

Uses:

ml5.js Facemesh:
