# Project 02: Anything {

#### Grade
* Proposal and prototype (10%)
* Final project (40%)

#### Deadlines

##### Proposal and prototype
* Section A (Tuesdays): 11:59PM, 16, 23, or 30 March 2021
* Section B (Thursdays): 11:59PM, 18, 25 March 2021 or 1 April 2021

##### Final project
* Section A (Tuesdays): 11:59PM, 23 April 2021
* Section B (Thursdays): 11:59PM, 25 April 2021

## Objectives

1. Working on a large-scale program
2. Using prototyping to explore ideas
3. Demonstrating mastery of course material
4. Continuing to find a voice as a creative programmer

## Brief

The final project can be **anything** you would like it to be. A simulation, a game, a work of digital media art, a musical toy, or anything else that successfully combines creativity and code. Because there are no specific limitations, there is a graded proposal/prototype stage to ensure you are headed in a reasonable and interesting direction before continuing on to complete the project.

Feel free to begin with any examples drawn from the course, making sure to **attribute** where you got them from. You may also begin with previous exercises or projects of your own, again making sure to **attribute** your starting point to make the new work for this project clear.

The final project will involve two milestones:

* [Part 1: Proposal and prototype](#part-1-proposal-and-prototype-10)
* [Part 2: Final project](#part-final-project-40)

---

## Part 1 - Proposal and prototype (10%)

The proposal and prototype stage will require you to write a **short proposal document** discussing the ideas and techniques you wish to explore in your final project, as well as to produce a **small prototype** that shows you are moving forward with the technical challenges involved.

### Deadline

* Section A (Tuesdays): 11:59PM, 16, 23, or 30 March 2021
* Section B (Thursdays): 11:59PM, 18, 25 March 2021 or 1 April 2021

**Tell Pippin when you submit.**

### Requirements

#### Proposal document

- A document provided as a **PDF** (`.pdf`) and included in the same folder as your prototype. (**No Microsoft Word or other formats.**) ideally in the path `projects/project2/proposal.pdf`
- The proposal document should be at least two pages long and should include
  - a written discussion of your artistic vision for the project
  - a discussion of your plans for the technical challenges the project will present
  - one or more annotated visual sketches (drawn, collage, or other approaches) of how the final project will look and behave according to your current vision

#### Prototype

- A JavaScript project (ideally in a the path `projects/project2/prototype/`)
- The prototype should be a small experiment that explores one or more ideas that will be fully implemented in the final project
- It might be a prototype of the style of interaction you will use, or a particular approach to sound, or a particular kind of animation, or something else
- The key is that is should give you a chance to make progress on the project code **and** should show that you are seriously thinking about your work
- The prototype should be roughly the scale of one an exercise, but more focused on a specific aspect of the final project you are proposing
- The prototype does **not** need to follow style rules rigidly (to allow you to work faster), but should at a minimum have reasonable naming conventions and formatting. Commenting is optional but encouraged for your sanity.

## Part 2 - Final project (40%)

The final project will be the culmination of your learning in the course and so its key objectives are to demonstrate your technical mastery of concepts covered as well as to show your artistic engagement with programming as a medium of expression. Because the course covers diverse topics, there is no expectation to use **all** the technologies discussed.

The final project will consist of an **artist's statement** and the final **p5 project**.

### Deadline

* Section A (Tuesdays): 11:59PM, 23 April 2021
* Section B (Thursdays): 11:59PM, 25 April 2021

### Requirements

#### Artist's statement

Your final project folder should include a `README.md` document in the main folder (e.g. `projects/project2/final/README.md`) that contains a brief artist's statement about your project. This statement should succinctly explain your artistic vision, the desired user experience, and how you believe you accomplished this both technically and artistically. This will help when evaluating the level of creativity you have brought to the project.

#### Coherent artistic direction

A key objective in the course is using programming to **express your ideas in code**, so it's important that your project be coherent, with a thoughtful and well-presented set of ideas that a user will experience through it. This does not mean the project needs to have a "message", but rather that you need a clear idea of what the project is meant to achieve and follow through with it.

#### Interactivity

Your project should be interactive.

#### Course material

The project is your chance to show mastery of concepts covered in the course. Because the course covers diverse subjects, there is no expectation to cover **all** the subjects. However, at a minimum you should be using at least **two** separate libraries/techniques in your work (e.g. p5.js **and** ml5.js, or jQuery **and** ResponsiveVoice).

#### Attribution

Any use of code or assets found online, through help from the instructor/TA/other students, or based on existing examples from the course or your own work, must be explicitly attributed. This should be in a comment in the location of the code included or at the top of the script for media from other sources. This is in large part to make sure you are evaluated for your own work rather than that of others.

#### Style

Style is very important in programming. Make sure you follow the [style guide](../../guides/style-guide.md), particularly for advice on commenting and naming.

#### Exceptions

If your dream project is likely to omit one or more of the above requirementss consult with the instructor before proceeding beyond the proposal/prototype stage (ideally earlier).

## Advice

1. __Start early__. Don't delay thinking about the project. Get your ideas together early so that you've got a good amount of time to work on them.
2. __Start small__. Think of the smallest possible version of what you want to make and make that first. Once it works, you can start adding to it.
3. __Seek help__. Ask for help early to discuss your idea and work out ways to achieve it, as well as to get specific technical help as you run into problems. If you can't think of an idea, ask for help with that. If you're freaking out, ask for help with that.
4. __Work consistently__. Don't leave project work compressed into a small amount of time just before the deadline. It never leads to good work and always leads to a lot of stress.
5. __Start early__. Don't delay thinking about the project. Seriously.

---

## Submission

Submission will take place on __Moodle__. Go to the appropriately named submission page on the Moodle and submit your work there. There will be separate submission pages for the **proposal and prototype** and the **final project**.

Your submission should just be plain text that includes:

1. A link to your project folder (including your proposal document or artist's statement)
2. A link to your running project

## Evaluation

### Proposal and prototype

Grading for the proposal and prototype will consider the following categories:

- __Implementation__ (50%)- the prototype code meets the requirements, has no errors, is ambitious in its use of the course material, points in an interesting direction, is appropriate as a stepping stone toward the final project.
- __Creativity__ (50%) - the proposed project as expressed in the proposal and prototype is interesting and expressive. It has a clear point of view and conveys it consistently. The prototype uses code in surprising ways to create new experiences. The proposed project is of a reasonable scope.

### Final project

- __Implementation__ (50%)- the code meets the requirements, show mastery over the course material, has no errors, is technically ambitious.
- __Creativity__ (30%) - the project is an interesting and expressive. It has a clear point of view and conveys it consistently. The project uses code in surprising ways to create new experiences.
- __Style__ (20%) - the code follows the [Style Guide](../../guides/style-guide.md). This includes code formatting.

### Grade breakdown

Each category will be graded as follows:

- __Excellent__ (A-range) - Meets requirements with no or almost no issues
- __Good__ (B-range) - Meets requirements with some minor issues
- __Adequate__ (C-range) - Meets requirements but with clear issues
- __Poor__ (D-range) - Barely meets requirements
- __Non-submission / Unacceptable__ (F)
