# Resources

The internet is full of amazing resources for learning how to program, and specifically for learning how to program in JavaScript and how to use the many available libraries. This is not a complete list, just an indication of a few good options.

__If you find a resource you think should be shared with the class, please notify the instructor (via email, an Issue on this repository, or even a Pull request) to have it added.__

## p5.js

- [Code! Programming with p5](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) - A brilliant series of video lectures by Daniel Schiffman, covering many of the same topics as this course. A great source of reinforcement learning.
- [p5 Reference](http://p5js.org/reference) - All the key information about what p5 can do
- [p5 Examples](https://p5js.org/examples/) - Examples of what p5 can do

## JavaScript

- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - A website devoted to learning to code, with excellent courses in JavaScript. A little dry, but very thorough.
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - Another website for learning to code, with good coverage of JavaScript. Again, not arts-oriented, but solid.
- [W3 Schools JavaScript Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) - Bare bones but solid tutorial from W3 schools
- [JavaScript First Steps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps) - Beginner JavaScript from the Mozilla Foundation
- [Getting Started with the Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) - Good introduction to the web and web programming more generally from the Mozilla Foundation
- [JavaScript Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide) - The Mozilla Foundation again with a complete guide to the language (gets pretty advanced)
- [Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn Haverbeke - A wonderful introduction to JavaScript, though it does get quite advanced quite quickly (might be good to read after this course)

## HTML/CSS

- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - A website devoted to learning to code, with excellent courses in HTML and CSS, and more. A little dry, but very thorough.
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - Another website for learning to code, with good coverage of HTML and CSS. Again, not arts-oriented, but solid.
